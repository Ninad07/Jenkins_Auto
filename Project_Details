Hello Learners
This is a project based on complete automation of website deployment using Jenkins, Git and Docker
It is used to automate a complete website hosting process using Jenkins.
For that purpose I have created two jobs- Prod_Deployment and Site_Testing in Jenkins

It has the following workflow:
1. The developer creates a webpage and uploads the code on GitHub
2. As soon as the developer commits the code, a post-commit webhook is triggered
3. This starts the Site_Testing Job. This jobs creates a tesing environment using Docker containers. The uploaded code of the webpage
   is first tested in the testin environment. 
4. If the code works properly, the second job Prod_deployment is triggered.
5. This job then uses the same code and deploys it.
6. If the Site_Testing job fails, Prod_deployment job does not start.

Usage steps are provided in the "instructions" file
